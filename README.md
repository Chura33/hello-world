This is a program that prints hello world
## Introduction
My name is **Nnamani Chukwura Rapheal**. I am learning software engineering to become a backend engineer through the ALX software engineering program.
Some of the technologies that I would learn are as follows 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- C
- SQL

I believe that by starting with simple code like:
`console.log('Hello World')`
I can become a good backend developer because ALX starts from the basics and make us learn at our pace.
ALX makes us   *DO HARD THINGS*
